# Building web applications in Java with Spring Boot 3

This course is a beginner's step-by-step guide to developing web applications using Spring Boot, the most popular framework for building Java applications. You'll learn about Spring Boot 3 and its role in enabling developers to deliver enterprise-grade applications. We'll dive into Spring's fundamentals by creating a REST API that communicates with a database and is supported by a comprehensive suite of tests. By the end of this course you will have learned what you need to start building your own web applications with Spring Boot 3.
